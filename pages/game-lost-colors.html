                <p><strong>Lost Colors</strong> is a first-person puzzle game for PC inspired by titles like <em>The Unfinished Swan</em>, <em>Perfect Angle</em>, <em>Superliminal</em> and <em>Viewfinder</em>.</p>
                <p>It&#8217;s a project developed in <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> during the Online Master at <a href="https://dbgameacademy.com/" target="_blank">Digital Bros Game Academy</a>, in collaboration with a team of Game Programming and Game Design students, between February and April 2025.</p>
                <p>It was a challenging and very formative experience. With limited time, we had to carefully divide tasks among ourselves. Good communication and <strong>teamwork</strong>, both among programmers and with the designers, were essential. We implemented their evolving ideas making sure they could easily play around and fine-tune everything in the Unreal Editor. We used some <strong>Blueprints</strong> during the development process, but the final game is almost exclusively in C++. As one of the four programmers on the team, I had the opportunity to apply and share my previously acquired game development skills, and at the same time I learned a great deal from my teammates.</p>
                <p>&#8594; Soon to be released on itch.io! Maybe. Probably!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Temporary color stains appearing on objects in gameplay (using decal materials) and on menu pages (using widgets)</li>
                    <li>Floating animation for key object fragments</li>
                    <li>Color mixing system that allows combining primary colors to create secondary colors</li>
                    <li>Integrated various game logic components (coloring, fragment management, perspective check and puzzle resolution) to bring the whole game flow together</li>
                    <li>Sound effects, background music, and muffled audio effect during &#8220;Focus Mode&#8221;</li>
                    <li>Debugging and bug fixing, some code refactoring</li>

                    <h3>One thing I&#8217;m pretty proud of</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>I developed a simple custom tool to <strong>position and scale</strong> key object fragments in 3D space, used to create a <strong>forced perspective illusion</strong>.</p>
                        <p>The tool performs a simple mathematical proportion between the initial distance from the point of view and the initial scale of the object, and the new distance and scale. The real challenge was designing a system that would be both <strong>intuitive for users</strong> with limited technical skills, and robust enough to avoid errors or unexpected behavior.</p>
                        <p>I&#8217;m happy that the designer team found it easy, practical, and effective to use.</p>
